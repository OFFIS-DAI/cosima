Welcome to cosima's documentation!
===================================

*cosima* is a tool to investigate the interactions between the power system and communciation network by integrating the (communication) simulator `OMNeT++ <https://omnetpp.org/>`_ into the co-simulation framework `mosaik <https://mosaik.offis.de/>`_.
This project aims to analyse the resilience and robustness of so-called Smart Grid Services (with a special focus on multiagent system-based services).
Therefore, cosima should enable scalable and extensible simulation scenarios.

To get the idea of cosima, we recommend reading :doc:`Overview`.
